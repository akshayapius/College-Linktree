# College Linktree

A link tree which helps in creating a link in which the user can display all of their required links to blogs, websites and social media pages. It organises and creates a structured view of all links relating to an individual, or in our case, organization. The link showcases various icons at first glance of the various platforms to which it is providing a link. On clicking the icons, it is redirected to the respective page. It thus helps neatly organise all of the userâ€™s crucial links into a single page.

In our link tree, which was created for a college, we provide all of the colleges major media pages, contact information, clubs hosted and links to the various departments and their respective websites. It provides an aesthetic and pleasing website with easy to use buttons, to easily obtain all the links of the college.

The website is made using HTML and CSS, deploying HTML features such as Bootstrap and Flexbox.
